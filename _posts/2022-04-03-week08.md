title: Week 8 Blog Post
---

This week, our group helped out Alex's set up.  
Somehow, the installation on his laptop was not working properly.  
We all spent about 30mins to solve the issue and tried various approaches.  
It's amazing that similar issues were suggested but it had not been fixed.  
We figured out the bypassing way, and able to run the program.  
Now we searched issues that we could work on it.  
We found the request of dark theme that is darker than anything currently exists.  
Thus, we all had to get ourselves familiarized with the contributing convention.  
Also, the data structure.  
We found the file that mapped css variables and which element is changing due to.  
We made the darkest theme and requested PR.  
I liked how our group was all active and fascinated by making one.  
Furthermore, we were all united and helped out each other.  
The active interchange of idea and future suggestion were also great.
