Our recent project, less-ugly-brightspace was really fun to work with.
The first plan was identifying each element that needs to be changed into dark mode
and we were only thought of doing for 3 essential pages of brightspace since picking
every element is burdensome work.
However, Lev suggested automated way, then Christian confirmed the web page I found.
I was able to come up with very simple but powerful logic which worked way better than I thought.
From this project, I was able to learn how precious and valuable to listening to others in different perspectives.
The teammates were super kind and responsible. Everyone really committed.

I also found team 5's project which was study timer interesting.
It has a few features that could enrich the project such as alarm when the timer is done,
change of fonts or UI. However, it seemed really useful to me. 
Also, Searchionary was impactful too. It's really simple logic but
it created a much bigger value. I must say it's a very clever idea.
