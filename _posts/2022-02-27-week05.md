### Part 1

The project that I had to evaluate was GNOME Clock.
I was certainly surprised because I could find many interesting things from this activity.
First of all, this project had two separate websites: one for regular users, one for the potential contributor.
The first website mainly mentions about the feature, how to install, where to contact and etc.
It supported various languages unlike the second website.
The second website however, had information about source repos, how to contribute, their mission and etc.
Furthermore, this project was particularly intersting because it seemed so simple but had enormous community with in the repo.
Many people involved in this project and contributed with ther own way.
It was amazing to realize that open-source is trully working as a global perspective.
