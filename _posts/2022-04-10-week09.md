# Part1

Learning about business models that could be applied  
to the open source was very interesting.  
As a future entrepreneur, I'm always excited to learn  
about different, fresh way to earn money.  
Although there were not a lot of new business model  
that we didn't discussed before,  
it was worth to refamiliarized and learn little deeper.  
Furthermore, I was impressed when the professor revealed  
that the author of the article  
that we were reading on was actually a college student  
just like us when he wrote it in 2015.  
It really opened my eyes that I could also contribute  
and be professional while I'm still a student.
I personally think firefox's advertisement partnership  
looks amazing because it doesn't affect user experience that much  
while they earn enormous amount of money.  
It seems like ideal business model to the services  
that promotes themselves as 'free to use'

The group project is working fine.  
We recently submitted editted PR so we finally  
able to add a new theme.  
Now our team is trying to not only get used to the  
extensions, but also  
we are thinking of making a entire new theme with  
other features.  
We figured various interesting facts of Spotify  
that we potentially alter and apply to our theme.  
The progressbar knot was our most hurdling issue  
and still don't have answer to change it into  
specific image, but we will figure out!
